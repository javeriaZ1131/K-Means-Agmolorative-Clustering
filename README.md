# Unsupervised Learning Algorithm

reasons for using Unsupervised Learning:
1 Unsupervised machine learning finds all kind of unknown patterns in data.
2 Unsupervised methods help you to find features which can be useful for categorization.
3 It is taken place in real time, so all the input data to be analyzed and labeled in the presence of
learners.
4 It is easier to get unlabeled data from a computer than labeled data, which needs manual
intervention.


Types of unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning problems further grouped into clustering and association problems.
Clustering   and K means Algorithm.

Here attempted to implement Kmeans and agmolorative clustering.
